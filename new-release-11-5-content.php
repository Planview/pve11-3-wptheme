            <h2 id="ribbon-reporting">Extending the Power of the Ribbon to Include Reporting</h2> Planview Enterprise 11.5 brings analytics and reports closer to users than ever before. Combining the sophistication of the Planview Enterprise ribbon and tiles with the breadth and depth of Planview Enterprise Analytics and Reporting Portal, users can access operational information in a consolidated location. Instead of having to access the Analytics and Reporting Portal, end users can now conveniently visualize at-a-glance reports, RPM Analytics, and custom reports in the ribbon promoting proactive decision making for all users.

        <div class="col-md-9">
            <h3>Reports Now Available as Tiles</h3> Reports, formerly only accessible in the Analytics and Reporting Portal, are now only a click away – embedded within the ribbon and tiles. Report access uses the familiar tile metaphor, introduced with Planview Enterprise 11, standardizing how users consume all information across Planview Enterprise. Administrators can build the best user experience for each user group by setting up where reports are available and defaulting key parameters.

            <h3>Enhanced RPM Analytics integrated into the Ribbon</h3> RPM Analytics reports are now available as preconfigured tiles. These reports have been refreshed with a completely new look and feel for an integrated experience. Each report has been optimized for the ribbon, with consistent, updated styling and an improved information layout. With Planview Enterprise 11.5, RPM Analytics reports are now released with every major Planview Enterprise release.

            <h3>Streamline Report Configuration and Distribution</h3> With reports now in the ribbon, sharing and administration becomes much simpler. Using the existing, flexible Planview Enterprise ribbon and tiles configuration capabilities, administrators can share reports with default layouts and control access with security features. Making this easier, Planview Enterprise 11.5 also allows administrators to represent how custom features are used by renaming them. (See Additional Enhancements - Renaming user security features for more information).

            <h2 id="customer-driven-enhancements">Manage the Strategy and Business of IT with Integration between Troux and Planview Enterprise</h2> Forging a vital link between enterprise architecture (EA) practices and project management offices (PMOs), Planview Enterprise 11.5 releases its first integration between Troux and delivers a unique solution for connecting strategy and execution to more effectively optimize resources and drive transformation initiatives. By integrating capability and technology management from Troux products with portfolio and resource management in Planview Enterprise, the integration gives IT leaders a consolidated planning and management environment. As a result, enterprise architects and PMOs can work together more effectively to execute business initiatives, make more informed IT portfolio decisions, and ultimately help IT organizations achieve strategic, organizational, and technical goals. There are two key components for this first generation integration:
            <ol>
                <li><a href="#conduct-project-assessments">Ability to assess potential projects</a>
                </li>
                <li><a href="#realizing-capability-driven-planning">Evaluate, measure and communicate by capability</a>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 id="conduct-project-assessments">Conduct Project Assessments</h3> By integrating demand management and portfolio planning in Planview Enterprise with technical assessments from Troux, organizations make better decisions with a more complete picture of each investment and assess the potential to impact the business. IT organizations can ensure that all new demand is properly analyzed and understood before going through capacity planning and project approval. The integration takes proposed projects from Planview Enterprise and sends them to Troux where enterprise architects can leverage the depth of information available to assess the technology and business risks. Planview Enterprise lifecycles provide governance to determine which projects to assess (be it all or some) and when it is required. Troux metrics such as EA alignment, capability importance, and the number of affected applications flow back to Planview Enterprise to ensure the portfolio assessment has a holistic picture of the investment. Once approved, project status flows back from Planview Enterprise to Troux to communicate progress.

            <h3 id="realizing-capability-driven-planning">Realizing Capability Driven Planning</h3> As discussed in “New Business Capability Dimension for Portfolio Management” above, capability-driven planning is vital to ensure resources are allocated to the core competencies of the business. While capabilities can be manually entered and managed in Planview Enterprise, improved accuracy and alignment is provided by integrating with Troux as the system-of-record for both capabilities and the relationship of those capabilities to projects. With the integration, Planview Enterprise receives the most up-to-date capability hierarchy and the proper mapping of capabilities to projects, thereby enabling a better understanding of how financial and human resources are planned against the business capabilities that define your business.

            <h3>Manage your Projects</h3>Typically, larger, more structured projects are managed in Planview Enterprise while more collaborative work is managed in Projectplace.
            <ul>
                <li>For more traditional projects, project managers can build and manage their full project plan and dates in Planview Enterprise, knowing that all of this information will flow to Projectplace enabling additional collaboration, particularly involving business participants.</li>
                <li>For collaborative work, projects plans managed in Projectplace flow to Planview Enterprise to enable downstream portfolio management use cases, including demand management, capacity planning, resource management and financial planning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Manage your Resources</h3>For teams where resource management use cases such as assignment workflows, utilization, and financial forecasting of planned assignments are applicable, resources can be managed in Planview Enterprise across all work, whether the work is being managed in Planview Enterprise or Projectplace. The integration enables specific enhancements including:
            <ul>
                <li>Shared assignments between Planview Enterprise and Projectplace, allowing the resources assigned in Planview Enterprise to automatically be invited to the Projectplace project</li>
                <li>Resource manager can compare planned assignments in Planview Enterprise to the card assignments in Projectplace</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Track your Time in Either Product</h3>Users can report time in either Projectplace or Planview Enterprise. If reported in Projectplace, through the integration, the time will be sent to Planview Enterprise for consolidation, understanding actuals and tracking costs.
